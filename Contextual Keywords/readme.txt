There are some keywords in C# that are considered contextual, in that their usage is determined by their context.  Technically, you are free to use these keywords as identifiers, without needing the ‘@’ symbol.  But you should avoid doing this, since it could lead to confusion.

The contextual keywords are:  
add, 
dynamic, 
get, 
global, 
partial, 
remove, 
set, 
value, 
var, 
where, 
yield
